    <h2>Detail Question and Answers on COVID-19 for Public</h2>
    <div class="maindiv">
        
        <div>
            <h4>What is corona virus?</h4>
            <p class="p-faqs">Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
                in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
                discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
                <h4>What is COVID-19?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">
                    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                    discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                    before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
                </p>
                <h4>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                    dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                    usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                    don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                    80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                    Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                    ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
                    or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
                    fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
                <h4>How does COVID-19 spread?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                    disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                    the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                    the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
                    objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
                    can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
                    with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
                    important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
                    who is sick.</p>
                    <p class="in-question-p">Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</p>
                    <p class="p-faqs">Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
                        transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
                        through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
                        spread?”</p>
                    <p class="in-question-p">Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</p>
                    <p class="p-faqs">The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                        expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                        from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                        people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                        particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                        possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                        a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>
                        <p class="in-question-p">Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</p>
                        <p class="p-faqs">The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                            appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                            be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
                            main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                            COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
                            this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
                            after using the bathroom and before eating</p>
                <h4>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                    there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.<br><br>
                    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                    still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                    areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                    and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                    case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                    disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                    COVID-19.<br><br>
                    COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                    has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                    new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                    situation where you are or intend to go</p>
                <h4>Should I worry about COVID-19?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
                    children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
                    1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
                    normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
                    affect them and their loved ones.
                    We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
                    loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
                    actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
                    hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
                    health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
                    movement and gatherings</p>
                <h4>Who is at risk of developing severe illness</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
                    older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
                    as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
                    diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.</p>
                <h4>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
                    outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
                    related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are
                    quite different. <br><br>
                    SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
                    There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since
                    2003.</p>
                <h4>Should I wear mask to protect myself?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
                    coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
                    Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                    looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
                    a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
                    wisely. <br><br>
                    We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
                    wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
                    effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
                    frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
                    or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
                    people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
                <h4>Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal
                    source?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
                    animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which
                    may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
                    associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary
                    camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been
                    confirmed. <br><br>
                    To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
                    direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure
                    good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal
                    organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid
                    consuming raw or undercooked animal products.</p>
                <h4>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h4>
                <p class="p-faqs">It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
                    surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
                    suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
                    COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                    several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
                    surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). <br><br>
                    If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
                    to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with
                    an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
                    touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
